            <p> When talking about shoes, people talk about the price or the color, but Marco's Sneakers focus on the story
                behind, the reason the shoe got made. Hopefull, after you've read some facts on my webpage, you'll learn something new, 
                and maybe you want to find out fact about your own shoe!

                    <p> Similar to the 2013, the two share the same original color theme of white, black and varsity red. 
                        The only difference here is the Nike Air branding on the tongue and insole and being factory unlaced. 
                        Also make note that the 2015 version is remastered which means they will feature premium materials and 
                        better construction process.</p>

                    <p> After surfacing in several light tonal colorways over the last few weeks, Nike’s storied Air Max 97 
                        has now arrived in a bright mustard yellow—a surprising switch of sorts as the Swoosh Brand has 
                        seemingly been trending towards a more minimalist approach when it comes to color palettes for the 
                        bullet train-inspired runner. Offering a bright and bold look perfect for summer or fall, this new 
                        “Mustard” 97 features an intense yellow on the mudguard and plunging upper panels.</p>
